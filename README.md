## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode, CLion)

### Compilation and Execution

1. Navigate to the desired directory:

   ```bash
   cd LinearList
   ```

2. Compile the C++ source file:

   ```bash
   g++ -o LinearList LinearList.cpp
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./LinearList
   ```

*Repeat the above steps for other directories as needed.*
